#### Were React's compilation warning/error messages helpful?
We think the warnings and error messages were pretty helpful in pointing out which lines of code had bugs. It caught errors such as undefined variables, unimported components, errors due to loading fetch requests.


#### Did React's compilation warning/error messages prompt you to consider making your site more accessible?
Not really, the warnings/ error messages were mostly related to good coding practices like warning about variables and functions that are declared but unused. Errors focused on things that were breaking functional components or preventing what the compiler suspects to be a common misunderstanding about some funcationality.


#### Did you consider conducting accessibility testing on your lab assignment? Why or why not?
Yes we did. We think it is important to perform web accessibility testing to ensure the functionality works correctly and can best serve the different needs of a set of diverse users.


#### If you tested your site for accessibility and found issues, were you able to solve them? What did you do to try to solve them? What stopped you from successfully resolving or trying to resolve the issues?
We used the WAVE extension to test whether the website was accessible by fixing contrast errors, added form labels for add comments, added alt texts to images and added approprite aria labels and roles. We also manually tested the website to ensure it was tabbable using the keyboard and that all the event handlers can be triggered using the spacebar or enter/ return keys.
